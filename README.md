# UltraSur: A Versatile Survival Analysis Tool for Multi-Omics Data in Cancer Research
## Data Acquisition Manifest
### TCGA omics data download form TCGA Pan-Cancer (PANCAN)  https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20Pan-Cancer%20(PANCAN)&removeHub=https%3A%2F%2Fxena.treehouse.gi.ucsc.edu%3A443 , in 12/24/2024 ,dataset information in dataset.csv

### methylation_preprocess.R, which explicitly demonstrates how probe-level beta values are mapped to gene-level data by retaining the first occurring probe, ensuring the methodology is transparent and reproducible.
### run_analysis_demo.R that allows users to perform the survival analysis (Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier plotting, and optimal cutoff determination) locally, reproducing the results generated by the UltraSur web server.
